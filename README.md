In "For Young Female Coders, Internship Interviews Can Be Toxic", Nitasha Tiku outlines the difficulties young women face in the technology industry. She highlights the fact that these struggles begin before women even join the workforce. I found this article interesting because it succintly sums up the difficult realities of being a female software developer in a personal and conversational way. Additionally, it briefly covers the "pipeline issue" in which girls and young women are discouraged from pursuing software engineering throughout school and even from a very young age, which resonates with my belief that there is a need for a more supportive environment for girls in tech. Although this article is a couple years old now, I like the way Tiku includes short interviews and brings up multiple aspects of the issue, and I think it makes a particularly relatable read for many college-age women in computer science. Reading on this issue is important for anyone who is going into technology, so that they are aware and can help contribute to a solution. It also draws attention to the fact that there are social issues at play even when discussing a seemingly unrelated topic, such as software engineering.
